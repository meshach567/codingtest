# Implementation Using a For Loop
# It can be a good idea to list what the code must contain or do before programming it:

# Two variables to hold the previous two Fibonacci numbers
# A for loop that runs 18 times
# Create new Fibonacci numbers by adding the two previous ones
# Print the new Fibonacci number
# Update the variables that hold the previous two fibonacci numbers
# Using the list above, it is easier to write the program:

prev2 = 0 
prev1 = 1

print(prev2)
print(prev1)

for fibo in range(18):
    newFibo = prev1 + prev2
    print(newFibo)
    prev2 = prev1
    prev1 = newFibo
