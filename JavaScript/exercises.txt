Task 1: 

Given an array arr[], the task is to reverse the array. Reversing an array means rearranging the elements such that the first element becomes the last, the second element becomes second last and so on.

e.g let arr = [1,2,3,4,5, 6]
Output: {5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1}
Explanation: The first element 1 moves to last position, the second element 4 moves to second-last and so on.

Task 2:
Given an array of integers arr[] of size n, the task is to rotate the array elements to the left by d positions.
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, d = 2
Output: {3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2}
Explanation: After first left rotation, arr[] becomes {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1} and after the second rotation, arr[] becomes {3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2}

Given an Array of size N and a value K, around which we need to right rotate the array. How do you quickly print the right rotated array?
Examples : 

Input: Array[] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, K = 2.
Output: 7 9 1 3 5
Explanation:
After 1st rotation – {9, 1, 3, 5, 7}After 2nd rotation – {7, 9, 1, 3, 5}



Input: Array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, K = 4.
Output: 2 3 4 5 1
